# Infracost Docs

This website is built using [Docusaurus 2](https://v2.docusaurus.io/).

### Installation

### Local Development

```

This command starts a local development server and open up a browser window. Most changes are reflected live without having to restart the server.

### Build

```
npm run build
```

This command generates static content into the `build` directory and can be served using any static contents hosting service.

### Deployment
